# Required Permissions

* Attach Files
  * Used to send the actual notifications
* Read Message History
  * Used for retrieving old messages the bot itself has sent

  * Mention the role you select during setup \(if any\)
* Add Reactions
  * Allows the bot to page through the `help` command and `monitor list` command
* Use External Emojis

Note:

If the above permissions are assigned to the Bot on the Server level, but you're still having issues, please make sure to check the permissions on the channel you are setting up the bot to send notifications in AND the channel you are running the commands in \(if it isn't the same channel\)

If you run into any difficulties, and just want it to "work", you can assign the bot "Administrator" for the Discord Server.
