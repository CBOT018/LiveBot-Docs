To invite the bot to your server, click the "Invite" link in the sidebar

## Support

You can join my support server if you have any issues by clicking [this link](https://discord.gg/zXkb4JP)

## Information

* Do NOT type `<>` or `[]` 
* `<` and `>` mark Required Parameters
* `[` and `]` mark Optional Parameters
* When running these commands, make sure to mention the BOT and not the ROLE that is auto created when you invite the bot to your server \(click "Invite" on the sidebar to invite the bot\).
* If the bot is online and not responding to your commands, make sure it has `Send Messages` permission in the channel you are running the commands.
