# Stop Monitoring a Stream

## Step 1

Stop monitoring a channel by running the following command

```text
@Live Bot#5263 monitor (stop/end/remove) [stream url]
```

## Step 2

If you didn't enter a `[stream url]`, the bot will ask you for the link to the stream you wish to start monitoring.  
Example: [https://twitch.tv/bsquidwd](https://twitch.tv/bsquidwd)
